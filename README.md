# Happy numbers

This repository includes functions in 3 (4 if you see TypeScript and JavaScript as seperate languages) different languages that determine wether a number is mathematically "happy". Every language folder also includes instructions on how to run tests for those functions. Every one of those functions follows the same idea, just implemented differently

# Why would you make this?

I am currently quarantined and have no project to work on so I am incredibly bored. It's also nice to practice languages I am not so good in, that's why I appreciate PRs to make the code better
