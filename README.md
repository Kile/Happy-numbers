## Happy numbers

This repository includes functions in 4 (5 if you see TypeScript and JavaScript as seperate languages) different languages that determine wether a number is mathematically "happy". Every language folder also includes instructions on how to run tests for those functions. Every one of those functions follows the same idea, just implemented differently

## What is a happy number?
> In number theory, a happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. For instance, 13 is a happy number because 
`1^2 + 3^2 = 10`
and 
`1^2 + 0^2 = 1`. 
On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starting with 
`4^2 = 16`
and 
`1^2 + 6^2 = 37`
eventually reaches 
`2^2 + 0^2 = 4`,
 the number that started the sequence, and so the process continues in an infinite cycle without ever reaching 1. A number which is not happy is called sad or unhappy.

### Why would you make this?

I am currently quarantined and have no project to work on so I am incredibly bored. It's also nice to practice languages I am not so good in, that's why I appreciate PRs to make the code better
